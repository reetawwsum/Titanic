Observations & Experimentations
===============================

1. Dataset contains 11 features, out of which one is target. I have to process every feature, in order to generalise my model.
2. There is no need of passenger ID in the model, hence discarding it while reading the dataset.
3. Passenger class is numeric, and seems important for generalisation. Plus no missing value.
4. I can't think any dependency of name with survival. Hence, dropping it.
5. Converting sex of a passenger into numerical value and adding it in feature list.
