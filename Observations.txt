Observations & Experimentations
===============================

1. Dataset contains 11 features, out of which one is target. I have to process every feature, in order to generalise my model.
2. There is no need of passenger ID in the model, hence discarding it while reading the dataset.
3. Passenger class is numeric, and seems important for generalisation. Plus no missing value.
4. I can't think any dependency of name with survival. Hence, dropping it.
5. Converting sex of a passenger into numerical value and adding it in feature list.
6. 177 passengers have missing age in dataset. That's almost 20 percent of training set.
7. Lets not consider age in the model for now.
8. Adding Sibsp and Parch in the feature list. Both contains no missing values.
9. I don't think I can use ticket number as a feature in my model. 
10. Leaving the ticket number for now.
11. Adding fare to the feature list.
12. 687 passengers have missing cabin data. It's 77 percent of training set.
13. Lemme verify whether it will be beneficial to add cabin data to the feature list.
14. 15 percent of passengers who are survived has their cabin data, whereas only 0.07 percent of passengers who are not survived has their cabin data.
15. Instead of a single model, titanic dataset will need model ensembles in order to classify the survived passengers.
16. Leaving cabin data for the feature list.
17. Only two passengers have missing embarked data.
18. Checking missing data in test dataset.
19. 1 passenger have missing fare data in test dataset.
20. No passenger have missing embarked data in test dataset.
21. I need to find a way to fill embarked data and fare data in train and test dataset respectively in order to use at least 6 feature list for my model.
22. Turned out, 15 passengers has 0 fare in dataset.
23. Finding average of fare for different pClass.
24. Average fare for 1st, 2nd, and 3rd class are 86.15, 21.36, and 13.79 respectively.
25. The problem with titanic dataset is number of unique passengers are only 445, if considering 5 features.
26. Two missing embarked passengers are both female, from first class, and both survived.
27. Filling missing embarked data with 'S' in train dataset, since more 1 class, female, survival boarded from S.
28. Instead of filling 177 missing age with mean or median, it's better to check what kind of relationship does age have with fare and class of a passenger.
29. Relationship is not straight forward. I'm thinking to use linear regression model to predict the age of the passengers first, and then use that to predict the survival.
30. I can generalise this to all missing values in dataset.
31. With 6 feature list, I'm getting 71-79 percent accuracy score on validation set using RandomForest Classifier.

32. Instead of filling the missing values in train and test dataset separately, it will be better if I merge them, and then fill the missing values, and separate it afterwards.
33. I have to perform feature engineering to create new features in order to get more accuracy.
34. Added family size to the feature list.
35. Adding title of the name to the feature list.
36. Total 875 different family names in dataset.
37. Added family name to the feature list.
38. But, family name is not helping. Discarding the code for family name.
39. Total 263 missing age in dataset.
40. Either, I can fill the missing age with -1, or mean value, or using regression method, predict the missing age in the dataset.
41. Filling the missing age with -1 doesn't help much.
42. Filling the missing age with mean, improves the accuracy.
